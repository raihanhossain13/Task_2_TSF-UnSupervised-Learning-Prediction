Author: Raihan Hossain
Task Summary: As part of The Sparks Foundation Internship Program (Task 2) in Data Science & Business Analytics, we employed unsupervised learning to analyze the Iris dataset. Our key achievements include:

Data Handling: We obtained the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning, containing measurements of iris flowers.

Clustering: Using clustering techniques, we identified the optimal number of clusters within the data, employing methods like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

Visualization: We visually represented the clusters with scatter plots, making it easy to grasp the dataset's underlying structure.

In essence, our work involved analyzing the Iris dataset, determining the ideal clusters, and presenting our findings through effective visualizations, enhancing our skills in data analysis and unsupervised learning.
